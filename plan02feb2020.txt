Plan of action:
Remove personal and possessive pronouns.
Identify NNS as a potential paginated query?? How to do this..
IN is a good clue for the start of an argument.
JJ is a potential argument.
CD is a potential argument (could be a word number, number, or UUID, for example)
JJR is a potential filtering argument..
DT is junk
CC is a coordinating conjunction (I think this is handled nicely without the tag)
